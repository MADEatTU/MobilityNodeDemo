# Mobility Node Demo
Proof of concept for CAN-bus connected mobility project modules.

This is a minimally viable circuit to prototype firmware and electrical designs communicating over CAN bus. Each board has one LED and three push buttons, allowing both targeted and global message passing to be tested. Boards are capable of daisy-chaining.
